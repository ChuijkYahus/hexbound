# Hexbound

[![powered by hexdoc](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://hexxy.media/api/v0/badge/hexdoc?label=1)](https://hexbound.hexxy.media)

Addon for Hex Casting adding programmable Constructs and more.

## Project status

This repository is a fork of [Cypher121](https://github.com/Cypher121)'s [Hexbound](https://github.com/Cypher121/hexbound). It is currently maintained by [object-Object](https://github.com/object-Object) (me!) with permission from Cypher.

My main priority is to get Hexbound back on CurseForge/Modrinth, set up a [hexdoc](https://hexdoc.hexxy.media) plugin, and possibly fix some outstanding bugs. I will not be adding new features or porting the mod to other platforms.
