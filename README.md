# Hexbound (fork)

[![powered by hexdoc](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://hexxy.media/api/v0/badge/hexdoc?label=1)](https://hexbound.hexxy.media)

[CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hexbound-fork) | [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/hexbound-fork)

Addon for [Hex Casting](https://github.com/FallingColors/HexMod) adding programmable Constructs and more.

Features:

* Constructs: machines you can order around with Hexes!
* Item and inventory management with spell patterns
* Drawing impossible patterns (don't tell anyone)

## Project status

This repository is a fork of [Cypher121](https://github.com/Cypher121)'s [Hexbound](https://github.com/Cypher121/hexbound). It is currently maintained by [object-Object](https://github.com/object-Object) (me!) with permission from Cypher.

My main priority is to get Hexbound back on CurseForge/Modrinth, set up a [hexdoc](https://hexdoc.hexxy.media) plugin, and possibly fix some outstanding bugs. I will not be adding new features or porting the mod to other platforms.

## FAQ

### Quilt Kotlin Libraries version

If you're having issues with the version of Quilt Kotlin Libraries / Fabric Language Kotlin on 1.19.2, try installing *both* of the following:

* [QKL 4.0.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/qkl/version/1.0.2+kt.1.8.0+flk.1.9.0)
* [QKL Core 4.0.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/qkl/version/4.0.0+kt.1.9.23+flk.1.10.19) or higher (the file starting with `quilt-kotlin-libraries-core`)

QKL targets a specific version of Minecraft, while QKL Core is what replaces FLK and can be used with any Minecraft version.
